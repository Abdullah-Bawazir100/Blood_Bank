Blood Bank Project Using Laravel Blade Template
# ----------------------------------------------------
This project represents an interactive Blood Bank web platform designed to enable users to securely sign in, create personal accounts, and register as blood donors. The system provides a user-friendly login interface for returning users, as well as a straightforward registration process for new users.

During registration, users are required to enter essential personal information, including full name, national ID or mobile number, age, blood type, and address. The platform also includes a dedicated donor registration form that captures all necessary medical and logistical details to determine donor eligibility. This includes health history, current medications, donation frequency, and contact information such as phone number and email.

The platform provides each donor with a personalized dashboard where they can update their profile, review past donation records, and receive notifications related to upcoming donation opportunities or urgent blood requests. All user data is stored within a secure environment that adheres to modern information security standards.

This system aims to streamline blood donation processes while ensuring accessibility, safety, and effective communication between donors and the blood bank.
